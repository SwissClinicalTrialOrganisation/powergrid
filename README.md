This is a beta-version of powergrid. It is tested a lot by me, Gilles. However, it would be great if you would work it for the next couple of weeks and send me feedback about anything you dislike or don't understand.

To install and use, run:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gillesdutilh/powergrid@beta_0.1.0", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(powergrid)
```
To get started, you may want to look at the vignette:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette('powergrid')
```
Please don't hesitate making an issu (above) or adjustind and making a pull request. Or you can write me an email.

I plan to submit the package to CRAN in June.

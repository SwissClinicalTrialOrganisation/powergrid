This is a beta-version of this package. It is tested a lot by me, Gilles. However, I would like to have you work it for the next couple of weeks and send me feedback about anything you dislike or don't understand.

Please don't hesitate making an issu (above) or adjustind and making a pull request. Or you can write me an email.

I plan to submit the package to CRAN in June.

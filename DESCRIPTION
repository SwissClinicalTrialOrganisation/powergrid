Description: Package powergrid allows users to easily evaluate a function across a grid of input parameters. At each crossing in the grid, a function may be evaluated once, or many times for simulation. Parallel computing is available. Utilities are aimed at performing analyses of power and sample size, allowing for easy search of minimum n (or min/max of any other parameter) to achieve a desired level of power (or any other objective). Also, plotting functions are included that present the dependency of n and power in relation to further parameters.
